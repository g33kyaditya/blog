So, I woke up this morning with this feeling of starting a blog(_again)_. TBH, I am not a very good blogger. This is my 3rd blog. Out of the other 2, I deleted one a couple of weeks ago and the very first one is still active. Although I don&#8217;t maintain it.

This time, i&#8217;ll be a good blogger (_maybe)_, and will try to maintain it to the best of my abilities. Still, I don&#8217;t make any promises. I&#8217;ll be blogging about anything to everything, whatever comes to my mind. And maybe sometimes my personal life too. I am not bounded by any word limit, so that means I can go on and on endlessly&#8230;
