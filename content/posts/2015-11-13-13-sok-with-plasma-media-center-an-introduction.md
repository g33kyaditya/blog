Hello people . Back with another post. This time about Season of KDE . For those who don&#8217;t know, SoK is a Google Summer of Code SpinOff in which students work on a project for an open source organization directly under the guidance of a seaoned mentor.

I got selected for my proposed idea of improving the Plasma Media Center Architecture. To be precise, it&#8217;s not just one task but a collection of tasks that I&#8217;ll be doing through my SoK period. SoK participants are required to blog about what they do, so I&#8217;ll be telling about it here often.

Apart from it, nothing new. Life&#8217;s usual. Have my Minors 2 right around and as usual I have no idea about anything. Got to finish close to 10 chapters for 2 subjects and finish one massive assignment before Monday, but here I am, your blogger. \*slow claps please\*

So this was the updates. More posts will follow. Also, I&#8217;ll be blogging thoroughly about SoK so stay tuned to catch up.

Thanks for Reading.
