Hey there !

You must have already noticed that I changed the site&#8217;s domain. This looks better to me. The month has been good till now. I am currently at home due to Holi holidays. Holi is an Indian festival in which people play with colors. There&#8217;s a whole story behind why it&#8217;s celebrated but I won&#8217;t go there. This is what it looks like.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-193" src="https://g33kyaditya.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/holi2.jpg" alt="holi2" width="651" height="386" />

I&#8217;ve never really played Holi that much. As far as I can remember maybe 3 or 4 times. I don&#8217;t like the whole concept of getting dirty and then cleaning up. But more so, the colors and the way they play it is what I can&#8217;t stand. The colors go into my eyes, nose, mouth and I have to cope up with its allergy for the next few days. So I find it better to stay at home.

Well, enough with Holi. I also have applied for Google Summer of Code this year to KDE. Let&#8217;s hope my proposal gets selected. Since I have about a week with me, due to these holidays, I have started learning OpenGL. It&#8217;s fun till now. But a bit above my skills since this is the first time I&#8217;m even reading about computer graphics. But all in all, it&#8217;s fun and interesting to learn. I have to put in quite some hours to understand how things work and believe me, the deeper you get, the complex it gets. I have also set up a github repoÂ [here][1], where I&#8217;ll be pushing all my programs that I&#8217;ll write during the course of it. In the end I hope to do some cool project in it. What project, I have no idea till now. But for now, I&#8217;ll just learn it.

Also, the past few weeks I have been watching Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden. IMHO, they are the best anime I&#8217;ve watched till now. Of course, leave the fillers. I just skipped them. The characters are portrayed well. Attention is given to detail. The story is not predictive and it is gripping. Battles are awesome. Just about everything I look for in an anime. I am well in sync with the last episode, so when new canon episodes release, I&#8217;ll be right on track.

I&#8217;m also eagerly waiting for Game of Thrones Season 6. Time just doesn&#8217;t pass when it comes to Game of Thrones. And it passes at an instant when I&#8217;m watching an episode. That&#8217;s the kind of effect it has on me.

Sometime back, we had our college annual fest. I didn&#8217;t attend. I simply couldn&#8217;t find my interest in there. The only thing which I really feel regretted for is not being able to try out Oculus Rift. Turns out, folks were letting students try the Rift and some of my friends tried it. Although, I have done Google Cardboard, but what&#8217;s Cardboard compared to a consumer grade Oculus Rift. That&#8217;s like comparing a working model of toy Ferrari to an actual Ferrari.

I have set up one more blog, but I&#8217;d like to keep it anonymous.

That&#8217;s all for now

Thanks for reading.
